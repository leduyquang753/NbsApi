# NbsApi
An API for reading and writing Note Block Songs (.nbs files.)

This is an in-development API for reading and writing Note Block Song files (.nbs)
that can be used in David's [Note Block Studio](https://www.stuffbydavid.com/mcnbs).
You can use it to read and write .nbs files without custom instruments (currently).
